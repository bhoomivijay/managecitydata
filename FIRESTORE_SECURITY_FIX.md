# 🔥 Firestore Access Control Error Fix

## Problem
You're getting this error:
```
Fetch API cannot load https://firestore.googleapis.com/google.firestore.v1.Firestore/Listen/channel?...
due to access control checks.
```

## Cause
This error occurs when Firebase security rules are blocking access to your Firestore database.

## Solution

### Step 1: Check Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `pulseai-blr`
3. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

### Step 2: Update Security Rules
Replace your current rules with these **OPEN RULES** (for development only):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Publish Rules
1. Click **Publish** to save the rules
2. Wait for rules to deploy (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

### Step 4: Test Your App
1. Refresh your application
2. Try the "Start Work" button again
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## ⚠️ Security Warning
**These rules allow anyone to read/write to your database. Only use for development!**

## Production Security Rules
For production, use proper authentication rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Alternative: Check Authentication
If you want to keep secure rules, ensure:
1. User is properly authenticated before accessing Firestore
2. Authentication state is properly initialized
3. User has required permissions

## Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for authentication errors
2. Verify user is logged in
3. Check Firebase Auth state
4. Ensure proper user role/permissions
